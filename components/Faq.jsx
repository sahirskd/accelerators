                            Solution Accelerators are designed to help you save hours of discovery, design, development and testing. Our goal is to jump-start your data and AI use cases by providing the right resources (notebooks, proven patterns and best practices). You can expect to go from idea to proof of concept (PoC) in as little as two weeks.
